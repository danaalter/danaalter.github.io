<title>About Me</title>
<h1>About Me </h1>
<p>My name is Dana Lea Alter. I am 26 years old and am a current student at the Miami International University of Art & Design. 
Originally from New York, I have now been living in Miami for a year and am already fully acclimated to strictly warm weathered surroundings. 
I was raised in the suburbs of northern New Jersey, and am admittedly too proud about it. I graduated from university in 2010 with a Bachelor's degree
in communications, and after a few years of work have decided to return to school to learn web design.
