	<h1>WE'VE HEARD OF HIM BEFORE</h1>
<p> He says he will one day be worth a billion dollars. He made fun of his collaboration partner's song on the radio. He announced his plans for running in the 2020 presidential election. He's interrupted live television speeches on more than three occasions (and said he has no regrets about it). He's publicly feuded with people over social media. He hails himself as the "Steve Jobs of the internet, downtown, fashion, and culture". He calls himself the most credible person in the world, adding that his fighting instinct has only led him to complete awesomeness. He was nominated for several Music Video Awards in 2006, but when he left empty handed he vowed to boycott the awards. He once showed his unique take on modesty when he famously revealed the greatest pain in his life is that he will never be able to see himself perform live. During a Huricane Katrina live TV public service announcement, he went off-script and said that George W. Bush doesn't care about black people. He was arrested for vandalizing a paparazzi's $12,000 camera. He posed as Jesus on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine. When his sneaker for Louis Vuitton debuted, he asked his fans to address him as "Martin Louis the King, Jr." moving forward. In 2009 he boasted on his blog that he didn't have a twitter account, but luckily for us, that has since changed.
