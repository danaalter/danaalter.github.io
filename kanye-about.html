	<h1>WE'VE HEARD OF HIM BEFORE</h1>
<p> What started as a Red Cross fund-raising drive for the victims of Hurricane Katrina turned into a minute-long televised rant criticizing the government's response to the disaster, culminating in his infamous, "George Bush doesn't care about black people". He's interrupted speeches on more than three occasions (and admits he still has no regrets about it- <em>sorry</em>, Taylor Swift). He calls himself the Michael Jordan of music. He has publicly feuded with people over social media. After an altercation with paparazzi, he was arrested for damaging a photographer's camera and also charged with misdemanor vandalism, battery as well as grand theft. He hails himself as the "Steve Jobs of the internet, downtown, fashion, and culture". When his sneaker for Louis Vuitton debuted, he asked his fans to address him as "Martin Louis the King, Jr. He calls himself the most credible person in the world, adding that his fighting instinct has only led him to "complete awesomeness". He once showed his unique take on modesty when he famously revealed his greatest pain in life is that he will never be able to see himself perform live.  He posed as Jesus on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine. He has already announced his plans for running in the 2020 presidential election. He says he will one day be worth a billion dollars, and asked Mark Zuckerberg, via facebook, to invest in his ideas. And lucky for us, he has a twitter account....
<br><h3>HE CERTAINLY NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION...</h3>
