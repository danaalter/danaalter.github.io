	<h1>WE'VE HEARD OF HIM BEFORE</h1>
<p> He says he will one day be worth a billion dollars. He made fun of his collaboration partner's song on the radio. During a live Huricane Katrina TV public service announcement, he announced that George W. Bush doesn't care about black people. He's interrupted speeches on more than three occasions (and admits he still has no regrets about it). He's publicly fueded with people over social media. He was arrested for vandalizing a paparazzi's $12,000 camera. He hails himself as the "Steve Jobs of the internet, downtown, fashion, and culture". When his sneaker for Louis Vuitton debuted, he asked his fans to address him as "Martin Louis the King, Jr."He calls himself the most credible person in the world, adding that his fighting instinct has only led him to "complete awesomeness". He boycotted the MTV Video Music Awards for a couple of years after not winning any of his nomincations in 2006. He once showed his unique take on modesty when he famously revealed the greatest pain in his life is that he will never be able to see himself perform live.  He posed as Jesus on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine.He has already announced his plans for running in the 2020 presidential election. In 2009 he boasted on his blog that he didn't have a twitter account, but luckily for us, that has since changed.
